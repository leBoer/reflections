Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, you instruct Git to start tracking the commits from that folder.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area works like an air lock towards your actual repository. You place your changed files there,
	and write up what the changes are. If the changes do not make up one logical commit, 
	you are given the option to remove them from the staging area. The value would be that it
	forces you to think through the logic of committing to a change.
